# Tic Tac Toe

A terminal based Tic Tac Toe game.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

This version of Tic Tac Toe includes the following features:

- The ability to play in two languages (defaults to English).
- A score count that keeps track of the number of wins and draws for each player.
- The option to play against a second player or against the computer, with four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, and impossible.
- The ability to continue a game after coming back to the menu or start a new one.
